# Chest X-ray Pneumonia Detection 🩻🤖

**Live Prediction App:** [Pneumonia Detection App](https://huggingface.co/spaces/THARUNIKA28/pneumonia-detection-app)

A deep learning model built using TensorFlow & Keras to detect Pneumonia from Chest X-ray images.

## 📁 Dataset
Used the **Chest X-ray dataset** from [Kaggle](https://tharunika28.github.io/Chest-Xray-Pneumonia-Detector/).

## 🚀 Model
- CNN with Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dropout
- Achieved **86.7% Test Accuracy**

## 🔍 How it works
1. Preprocessed X-ray images (224x224)
2. Trained model on Normal vs Pneumonia
3. Predicts on new X-ray images

## 🖼️ Example Prediction
Upload an image and get the result as either:
- 🟢 **Normal**
- 🔴 **Pneumonia**
